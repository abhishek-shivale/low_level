# Complexity

## 1. **Big O, Big Θ, Big Ω**

- Big O (Upper Bound - Worst case) - Describes the maximum time (or memory) an algorithm could take as input grows.
- Big Ω (Lower Bound - Best case) - Describe the minimum time an algorithm will take.
- Big Θ (Tight Bound - Average case) - Describes the average running time or when upper and lower bounds are the same.

### Hierarchy - `Ω(best) ≤ Θ(average) ≤ O(worst)`

## 2. Time vs Space TradeOff

- Sometimes, to make an algorithm run faster, we use more memory (space).
- Trade-off: Faster time but more memory usage.
